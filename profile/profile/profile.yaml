    description: In our cluster monitoring project, we embarked on a comprehensive journey to streamline the process of monitoring hardware and usage specifications within a Google Cloud environment. Our project began with the creation of a dedicated Google Cloud instance, equipped with a Linux CentOS operating system. To facilitate remote access and management, we integrated VNC Viewer into our setup.To kickstart our development process, we leveraged IntelliJ Studio, a powerful integrated development environment, and downloaded it onto our instance.This served as the foundation for our coding efforts. Our collaboration and version control efforts were centered around a GitHub repository at `git@github.com:jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NisargKhandhar.git`. Within this repository, we meticulously organized our work across three branches.Feature Branch This branch became the home for all code-related activities, where we collectively added and fine-tuned various features.
      Develop Branch Here, we curated the main changes and refinements to our codebase, ensuring that it was stable and met our project's core requirements.
      Master Branch:Our master branch served as the pinnacle of our project, housing the most polished and production-ready code.
      As part of our data management strategy, we employed Docker and PostgreSQL to create a robust database capable of storing extensive hardware and usage specification data. This infrastructure laid the groundwork for our data-driven monitoring system.
      To gather essential hardware and usage specifications, we ingeniously integrated bash scripts into IntelliJ Studio. These scripts allowed us to collect crucial data from the cluster environment seamlessly.
      One of the standout features of our project was our implementation of crontab. This tool enabled us to fetch real-time data at scheduled intervals, ensuring that our monitoring system provided up-to-the-minute insights into the cluster's health and performance.
      To ensure the project's transparency and accessibility, we diligently uploaded the entire codebase, along with relevant documentation, to our GitHub repository. This not only facilitated seamless collaboration but also showcased our commitment to open-source principles.
      In summary, our cluster monitoring project was a testament to our skills in cloud computing, database management, coding, and project collaboration. It underscored our ability to create a robust monitoring solution within a cloud environment and showcased our commitment to best practices in software development and version control.
