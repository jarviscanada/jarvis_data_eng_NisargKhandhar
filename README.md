**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](git@github.com:jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NisargKhandhar.git)]: In our cluster monitoring project, we embarked journey to streamline the process of monitoring hardware and usage specifications within a Google Cloud environment. Our project began with the creation of a dedicated Google Cloud instance, equipped with a Linux CentOS operating system. To facilitate remote access and management, we integrated VNC Viewer into our setup.
- To kickstart our development process, we leveraged IntelliJ Studio, a powerful integrated development environment, and downloaded it onto our instance. This served as the foundation for our coding efforts.
- Our collaboration and version control efforts were centered around a GitHub repository, we meticulously organized our work across three branches.
  -   Feature Branch This branch became the home for all code-related activities, where we collectively added and fine-tuned various features.
  -   Develop Branch Here, we curated the main changes and refinements to our codebase, ensuring that it was stable and met our project’s core requirements.
  -   Master Branch:Our master branch served as the pinnacle of our project, housing the most polished and production-ready code.
- As a part of our data management strategy, we employed Docker and PostgreSQL to create a robust database capable of storing extensive hardware and usage specification data. This infrastructure laid the groundwork for our data-driven monitoring system.
- To gather essential hardware and usage specifications, we ingeniously integrated bash scripts into IntelliJ Studio. These scripts allowed us to collect crucial data from the cluster environment seamlessly.
- One of the standout features of our project was our implementation of crontab. This tool enabled us to fetch real-time data at scheduled intervals, ensuring that our monitoring system provided up-to-the-minute insights into the cluster’s health and performance.

## Highlighted Projects
**Jogging Buddy** [https://bitbucket.org/nisargv/jogging_buddy/commits/]: Collaborated with team member to create an app using Swift based application using Xcode 14.0 with the Firestone firebase functionality to go for a run and calculate the heart rate and run statistics. Created it with competitive leaderboard as the gyms were closed due to covid-19. Just to solve the problem of people competing and socializing.

**Meet & Greet App** [https://github.com/nisargvk/Meet-Greet.git]: Created app in XCode using Swift, that helps hosting and finding meetups and gatherings. Used Firebase authentication for storing data. During peak covid-19 the resturants were closed and only public facilities like parks were open this application serves the solution for that purpose.

## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (September 2023-present)**: During our training program, we will have the opportunity
to work on a diverse range of projects spanning various domains and technologies. 
- These projects will encompass the following key areas Java Development We will delve into Java development projects, where we will design and implement Java applications, leveraging the language’s robust features and capabilities.
-  These projects may involve creating desktop applications, web applications, or backend services.
